# Interactive Piano

This interactive piano was made with JavaScript & React. It illustrates the abilty to pull mp3 audio from CDN's and playing that audio whenever you click on one of the keys.

Each key was styled using CSS.

# Future Goals:
1) Allowing users to choose how many octaves to display or where to start/end the keyboard
2) Changing sounds from just piano
3) Instead of using CDN's, download sounds before clicking to deal with input lag# interactivepiano
